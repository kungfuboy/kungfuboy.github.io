For example:\n *\n *                                            <Paper>\n *  <Paper>                                     <div> // See notice\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>        renders         <div/> // before element\n *      [children of paper]       ------>         [children of paper]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                       <div/> // after element\n *  </Paper>                                    </div>\n *                                            </Paper>\n *\n *  Notice: Notice that this div bundles together our elements. If the element\n *    that we want to apply before and after elements is a HTML tag (i.e. a\n *    div, p, or button tag), we can avoid this extra nesting by passing using\n *    the BeforeAfterWrapper in place of said tag like so:\n *\n *  <p>\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>   do this instead   <BeforeAfterWrapper elementType='p'>\n *      [children of p]          ------>         [children of p]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                    </BeforeAfterWrapper>\n *  </p>\n *\n *  BeforeAfterWrapper features spread functionality. This means that we can\n *  pass HTML tag properties directly into the BeforeAfterWrapper tag.\n *\n *  When using BeforeAfterWrapper, ensure that the parent of the beforeElement\n *  and afterElement have a defined style position.\n */\n\nvar styles = {\n  box: {\n    boxSizing: 'border-box'\n  }\n};\n\nvar BeforeAfterWrapper = function (_Component) {\n  _inherits(BeforeAfterWrapper, _Component);\n\n  function BeforeAfterWrapper() {\n    _classCallCheck(this, BeforeAfterWrapper);\n\n    return _possibleConstructorReturn(this, Object.getPrototypeOf(BeforeAfterWrapper).apply(this, arguments));\n  }\n\n  _createClass(BeforeAfterWrapper, [{\n    key: 'render',\n    value: function render() {\n      var _props = this.props;\n      var beforeStyle = _props.beforeStyle;\n      var afterStyle = _props.afterStyle;\n      var beforeElementType = _props.beforeElementType;\n      var // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars\n      afterElementType = _props.afterElementType;\n      var // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars\n      elementType = _props.elementType;\n\n      var other = _objectWithoutProperties(_props, ['beforeStyle', 'afterStyle', 'beforeElementType', 'afterElementType', 'elementType']);\n\n      var prepareStyles = this.context.muiTheme.prepareStyles;\n\n\n      var beforeElement = void 0;\n      var afterElement = void 0;\n\n      if (beforeStyle) {\n        beforeElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.beforeElementType, {\n          style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, beforeStyle)),\n          key: '::before'\n        });\n      }\n\n      if (afterStyle) {\n        afterElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.afterElementType, {\n          style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, afterStyle)),\n          key: '::after'\n        });\n      }\n\n      var children = [beforeElement, this.props.children, afterElement];\n\n      var props = other;\n      props.style = prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, this.props.style));\n\n      return _react2.default.createElement(this.props.elementType, props, children);\n    }\n  }]);\n\n  return BeforeAfterWrapper;\n}(_react.Component);\n\nBeforeAfterWrapper.propTypes = {\n  afterElementType: _react.PropTypes.string,\n  afterStyle: _react.PropTypes.object,\n  beforeElementType: _react.PropTypes.string,\n  beforeStyle: _react.PropTypes.object,\n  children: _react.PropTypes.node,\n  elementType: _react.PropTypes.string,\n  /**\n   * Override the inline-styles of the root element.\n   */\n  style: _react.PropTypes.object\n};\nBeforeAfterWrapper.defaultProps = {\n  beforeElementType: 'div',\n  afterElementType: 'div',\n  elementType: 'div'\n};\nBeforeAfterWrapper.contextTypes = {\n  muiTheme: _react.PropTypes.object.isRequired\n};\nexports.default = BeforeAfterWrapper;\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./~/material-ui/internal/BeforeAfterWrapper.js\n **/","'use strict';\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n  value: true\n});\nexports.default = undefined;\n\nvar _FloatingActionButton = require('./FloatingActionButton');\n\nvar _FloatingActionButton2 = _interopRequireDefault(_FloatingActionButton);\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ?

Let's the build system minify keys\n * without losing the ability to dynamically use key strings as values\n * themselves. Pass in an object with a single key/val pair and it will return\n * you the string key of that single record. Suppose you want to grab the\n * value for a key 'className' inside of an object. Key/val minification may\n * have aliased that key to be 'xa12'. keyOf({className: null}) will return\n * 'xa12' in that case. Resolve keys you want to use once at startup time, then\n * reuse those resolutions.\n */\n\"use strict\";\n\nvar keyOf = function (oneKeyObj) {\n  var key;\n  for (key in oneKeyObj) {\n    if (!oneKeyObj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {\n      continue;\n    }\n    return key;\n  }\n  return null;\n};\n\nmodule.exports = keyOf;\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./~/react-tap-event-plugin/~/fbjs/lib/keyOf.js\n **/","import React from 'react';\n\nconst Home = () => (\n  <div>Home</div>\n);\n\nexport default Home;\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./src/components/Home.jsx\n **/","import React from 'react';\n\nconst ITPosts = () => (\n  <div>ITPosts</div>\n);\n\nexport default ITPosts;\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./src/components/ITPosts.jsx\n **/","import React from 'react';\n\nconst Think = () => (\n  <div>Think</div>\n);\n\nexport default Think;\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./src/components/Think.jsx\n **/"],"sourceRoot":""}
